## Current Status
IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

Centered around a small device mimicking a plant marker that holds small sensors and processors that record and process information about different plants. Basic sensing capabilities include: soil moisture level, air and soil temperature level, light level. Basic processing for all these measurements either locally or through bluetooth communication to a remote backend. Ultimately functions as a convenient way to reduce ambiguity in home indoor plant care.

## Educational Value Added

Applying content from disciplines of embedded systems, software design, hardware IO interfacing, and Real time systems.
